# Email to Card Plus

This solution is built using Contalist, CloudMailin and a Deta Micro application.

The pre-requisites includes :
- embed a the {cardid} on the email e.g **Our Card Reference : IuyU5CS5**
- an internal reference for email filter to forward email to the CloudMailin email address e.g. **Internal Reference : 9acbc162ecfd92db3272**

Using Contalist, the above can be built into email templates.

With the pre-requisites in place, the additional capabilities of this solution included :
- create the comment using the email subject and body on **any card**. There is no need to share Trello card email address
- adds attachment(s) to the card, if this is included in the email.
- Since the entire email content is available to the endpoint, the application can be modified for specific needs e.g. to display the sender email address on the card description.
